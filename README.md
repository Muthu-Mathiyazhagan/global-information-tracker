<h3><i>Squash merge </i> </h3>

You can abort while doing merge only;
git merge --abort


git merge --squash bugfix # Performs a squash merge
---
* This not like regular Merge but Regular Commit
* this will add new changes on top of Master


To Maintain Linear History :
This is not mandatory but good to have

* Always Remember to Delete Merged Branch if you dont need no longer,
Because that POINTER (Branching) will create confutions in Future
